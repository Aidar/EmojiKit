# Release Notes

EmojiKit will use semver after 1.0. 

Until then, minor updates may remove deprecated features and introduce breaking changes.



## 0.3

This version makes the EmojiKit foundation open-source.

As such, there are many breaking changes in this version, too many to list here.

The biggest changes is this release is moving out some types from within the `EmojiType`, since the library is now smaller and no longer needs these API surface area optimizations.

EmojiKit also no longer contains UI components or assets. These will be available as a Pro add-on, and will include grids, pickers and vectorized assets.
