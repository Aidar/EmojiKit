# Release Notes

EmojiKit will use semver after 1.0. 

Until then, minor updates may remove deprecated features and introduce breaking changes.



## 0.5

This version adds support for strict concurrency.

The strict concurrency change required the library to remove the shared `FrequentEmojiProvider`, and instead let you provide your own instance.

A side-effect of this is that the `.frequent` emoji category no longer defines emojis in itself, but is instead only used as a placeholder that defines the id, title, icon, etc. for the category.

While this may seem more complicated, it *is* actually a better system design, since it lets us inject different providers instead of relying on a shared single instance. This is more flexible and obvious when you use the SDK.  

### ‚ú® New Features

* `Emoji` now conforms to `Hashable`.
* `Emoji.GridSelection` now conforms to `Hashable`.
* `MostRecentEmojiProvider` now lets you use a custom persistency key.
* `ScrollViewProxy` can now scroll to a specific `Emoji.GridSelection`.

### üí° Changes

* `EmojiCategory.frequent` no longer returns any emojis.
* `EmojiGrid` now lets you inject a custom frequent emoji provider.



## 0.4

This version adds a new EmojiGrid component.

### ‚ú® New Features

* `EmojiGrid` is a new grid component.
* `EmojiGridStyle` is a new, environment-based style.
* `Emoji` has more nested components that are used by the grid. 



## 0.3

This version makes the EmojiKit foundation open-source.

The biggest changes in this version, is that there are no longer any throwing SDK features. This version also moves types out from the `Emoji` type, since the SDK is smaller than before.

This version also removes UI components and assets. These will be available in future updates.



## 0.2

This update tweaks a few things in EmojiKit.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* This update fixes a problem that made the SDK not include macOS support
* This update fixes a bundle problem when resolving images and localized strings.



## 0.1

This is the very first beta release of EmojiKit.

### ‚ú® New Features

* `Emoji` is a struct with Emoji-specific properties and features, and also serves as a namespace for the library.
* `Emoji` supports unicode information, localization, search, categories, skin tones, and emoji version information.
* `Emoji` also has `Grid` and `Picker` UI components.
